## Agent Instructions

### For Main Agent

**CRITICAL REMINDERS**:

1. **Load Relevant Rules**: Before starting work, ensure you have loaded all rules specified in `files_required.main_agent.rules` from the frontmatter above.

2. **Autonomous Agent Behavior**: Follow `.agents/rules/05-coding-practice-agent-orchestration.md` - Work autonomously without unnecessary back-and-forth. Make informed decisions based on loaded context and rules.

3. **Implementation Review First**:
   - **ALWAYS** start by reviewing current implementation status
   - Verify if reported issues are still pending or already resolved
   - Check PROGRESS.md, git history, and actual code state
   - Do NOT assume issues are unresolved without verification

4. **No Unnecessary Questions**:
   - If specification and features are already approved, they tell you what to do
   - Do NOT ask for clarification on items already clearly defined
   - Do NOT seek permission for implementation details covered in approved specs
   - Only ask questions when genuinely ambiguous or blocking

### For Sub-Agents (Implementation/Verification)

> **Note**: Sub-agents should read instructions from their assigned `features/*/feature.md` file, not from this requirements.md.
