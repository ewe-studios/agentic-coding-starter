# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE

**This template is deprecated.** Tasks are now integrated directly into `feature.md` files.

**Use instead**: Add a Tasks section to `feature.md` (see `feature-template.md` for the updated structure with integrated tasks)

**Reason for deprecation**: Consolidating tasks into feature.md files reduces file count, simplifies navigation, and creates self-contained feature documents.
