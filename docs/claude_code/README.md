# Claude Code System Documentation

This directory contains documentation about the Claude Code CLI system that powers AI agent interactions in this project.

## Contents

1. **[system-prompt.md](./system-prompt.md)** - The system prompt that defines Claude's behavior and capabilities
2. **[system-tools.md](./system-tools.md)** - Complete reference of all available tools Claude can use
3. **[memory-files.md](./memory-files.md)** - Memory files currently loaded in the context window

## Purpose

This documentation serves as a reference for:
- Understanding what instructions Claude receives by default
- Knowing what tools are available for automation
- Tracking which memory files (project context) are loaded
- Debugging agent behavior and tool usage

## Usage

These files are automatically generated snapshots of Claude Code's current configuration. They help:
- **Developers**: Understand the AI's capabilities and constraints
- **Agent Engineers**: Design better agent workflows using available tools
- **Debuggers**: Diagnose issues with agent behavior or tool access
- **Documentation**: Record what the AI system knows and can do

## Updates

This documentation should be regenerated whenever:
- System prompt changes significantly
- New tools are added or removed
- Memory file configuration changes
- Major Claude Code version updates
